    <h1>NAIVASHA,THE PLACE TO BE</h1>
      <p>I had been feeling unmotivated and slumped for a while.It had taken such a huge toll on me to a point where i was struggling to do the bare minimum.This went on for quite sometime until one Friday evening, my husband,Hosek, suggested that we visit Naivasha for the weekend.</p>
      <p>Thats how we ended up in my version of heaven on earth.</p>
      <p>The serenity and clear air that Naivasha holds is quite frankly to die for. The beautiful landscapes, the exquisite,top-notch hotels, the kind people, the often calm weather...Naivasha spoke to my heart.<img src="lake-naivasha-getty.jpg" alt="a photo of the beautiful lake Naivasha"></p>
      <p>We visited a number of places within the town and every stop was another reason to truly appreciate the town.</p>
      <p>Here are a few places we visited.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Hell's gate<img src="hellsgate.jpg" alt="a photo of hellsgate"></li>
          <li>Lake Naivasha<img src="hippo.jpg" alt="a photo of the lake"></li>
          <li>Mount Longonot<img src="longonot.jpg" alt="a photo of mt longonot"></li>
        </ol>
      <p>These are just but some of the beautiful places Naivasha has to offer. I left the town feeling relaxed,energized and more of myself.</p>
      <p>Don't take my word for it. Be sure to visit Naivasha and have breathtaking experiences with your loved ones this vakentines. Here is a link you could use to book your stay.<a href="https://africasafarisadventure.com/">africasafarisadventure</a></p>
